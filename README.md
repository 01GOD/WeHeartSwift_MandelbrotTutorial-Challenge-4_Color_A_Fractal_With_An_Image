# WeHeartSwift_MandelbrotTutorial-Challenge-4_Color_A_Fractal_With_An_Image
This repository is a project to update the iOS app from the "color a fractal with an image" section (MandelbrotTutorial-Challenge-4) of https://www.weheartswift.com/make-ios-fractal-app/ so that it runs properly in iOS 14+. Contributions and collaborators are welcome! 

THANKFULLY the project had a submission from Robbie Moyer (https://github.com/moyerr) today and now the app builds and runs in Xcode 12.4!!! (iOS 14)

BIG THANKS to Robbie Moyer!!! 

Note: To change coordinates, do a 2 finger pan gesture. Yes, planning to add an image loader soon.
